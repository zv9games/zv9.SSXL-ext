# ü™ê SSXL-ext: The Dimension-Agnostic Generation Engine

![SSXL-ext Banner](SSXL-ext.png)

**SSXL-ext** is a high-performance, modular procedural generation engine written in **Rust**, designed to integrate seamlessly with **Godot 4.2+** via **GDExtension**. It doesn‚Äôt simulate worlds‚Äîit forges them. In milliseconds.

> ‚ÄúSSXL-ext is not a game‚Äîit‚Äôs the genesis point for your game.‚Äù

## ‚ö°Ô∏è The Breakthrough

> üß® 3.8 million tiles placed in 4 seconds.  
> üö´ GDScript queue eliminated.  
> ‚úÖ Rust writes directly to Godot‚Äôs `TileMap`.

The engine now bypasses Godot‚Äôs scripting layer entirely. Chunks are generated asynchronously in Rust and applied synchronously to the `TileMap`‚Äîno queue, no delay, no mercy.

## üöÄ Core Features

- **Direct TileMap Integration**  
  Rust sends `ChunkData` straight to Godot‚Äôs rendering layer. No intermediaries.

- **Multithreaded Generation**  
  Worker threads spawn via `ssxl_sync`, generating chunks in parallel.

- **Modular Algorithms**  
  Swap between Perlin, Cellular Automata, Maze, Cave, Solid Fill, Checkerboard‚Äîno engine changes required.

- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**  
  Rust‚Äôs performance profile ensures no overhead, even at scale.

- **Godot as a Visualizer**  
  SSXL treats Godot as a high-speed renderer‚Äînot a processor.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable)
- Godot 4.2+
- Set `GODOT4_BIN` environment variable to your Godot binary path

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Build the Rust core and GDExtension
cargo build --release

# The compiled library will appear in `target/release/`
# Open the Godot project tester (SSXL_engine_tester) and run!
```

## üß† Philosophy

SSXL-ext is built on the principle of **separation of concerns**.  
Rust handles the math, the noise, the concurrency.  
Godot handles the visuals, the physics, the scripting.  
Together, they form a symphony of speed and control.

> SSXL-ext doesn‚Äôt wait for the world to load. It builds the world while you play.

## üìù Naming Conventions

| Current File Name             | Module         | Recommended Name       | Reasoning                                      |
|------------------------------|----------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `cellular_automata_generator.rs` | ssxl_generate | `cellular_automata.rs` | `_generator` is implied by context             |
| `perlin_generator.rs`        | ssxl_generate   | `perlin_noise.rs`       | More specific, keeps generator context clear   |
| `cli_util_actions.rs`        | ssxl_cli        | `cli_actions.rs`        | `_util` is verbose and redundant               |
| `cli_util_bench.rs`          | ssxl_cli        | `cli_bench.rs`          | Concise and clear                              |
| `cli_util_inspect.rs`        | ssxl_cli        | `cli_inspector.rs`      | Noun form better reflects logic/commands       |
| `cli_util_menu.rs`           | ssxl_cli        | `cli_menu.rs`           | Streamlined                                    |
| `generation_utils.rs`        | ssxl_math       | `math_helpers.rs`       | Clarifies role as supplementary logic          |

## üßä Performance Notes

- **ChunkData is king**  
  Entire chunks are transferred as bulk payloads‚Äîno per-tile calls.

- **Rendering is synchronous**  
  TileMap updates happen on the main thread, instantly.

- **Cache-aware generation**  
  Chunks are loaded from cache or generated on-demand, then stored.

- **No queue, no lag**  
  The GDScript queue is gone. The bottleneck is gone. The legend begins.
